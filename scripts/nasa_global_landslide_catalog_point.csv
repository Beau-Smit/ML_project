Two falling boulders—maintenance workers on the scene said the largest was about 10 feet by 11 feet—dented and cracked the pavement.  As of Friday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol stopped traffic at Kenzo Estate winery, 3200 Monticello Road, near the top of the ridge. The slide was about a half-mile to the north, where workers using a backhoe cleared rocks from the narrow, two-lane road and adjacent hillside.  When the road will reopen remained unclear on Friday. More must be done than clean up and repair the pavement.

Trey Denison, superintendent of Fire Mountain Canal and Reservoir Company, had a crew at the scene working to dig out the canal on Wednesday and restore irrigation water sometime on Friday, July 8. Helping Denison with the work were ditch rider Scott Howell and Chuck Chesnik on the caterpillar and another contract worker. A representative of the Bureau of Reclamation was taking pictures.

Geologists say landslides are common and form a lot around Colorado.  ""A landslide is just a movement of earth. It is like an avalanche. But, instead of snow, you have dirt,"" said James Hagadorn, the curator of geology for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.  ""It happens because it's sliding downhill. It's heavier, and it's slippery. It's like a bar of soap on a board, you wet that board, and that soap is going to slide down,"" he said.  The landslide has recently been repaired. Hagadorn says that there are several engineering techniques that can be used to help stabilize it. And the best way to keep people safe is to monitor it, which geologists and engineers do regularly.

Clark County road crews on Monday closed one southbound lane at least until next week, giving them enough time to shore up 25 feet of embankment. Officials expect the repair will cost about $150,000.  “We need to re-establish the integrity of the slope,” said Greg Shafer, operations manager for Clark County Public Works.  Shafer said the lane may remain closed until the end of next week. Additional lane restrictions are possible during paving and repairs.  The highway includes two lanes in each direction, with a center turn lane.  Officials suspect stormwater runoff from heavy rain on Sunday flowed through old guardrail post holes on the west side of the highway, triggering the landslide.

Highway engineers say damage to KY 93 between the 8 and 9 mile marker south of Eddyville is so serious the project is more about rebuilding the roadway rather than repairing it.  The heavy rain that lead to near-record flooding across the region saturated the soil causing the roadway to drop as much as 10 feet along about a 1500-foot section of highway in the Eddy Creek area.  Early estimates indicate the cost of repair will be about $600,000.  This week, a contractor that specializes in landslide repair has drilled and placed steel posts into the slide area to help stabilize the soil.  Starting Monday the crew will drive pilings along the lower edge of the slide to further stabilize the area.

No one was hurt, and the nearest home — a green two-story bungalow at 1919 Eldridge Ave. — took no damage to the building or its yard, said Bellingham Assistant Fire Chief Bill Hewett.  Mud, sand and blackberry bushes fell onto the railroad tracks below, covering the northernmost track. Crews from BNSF cleared the debris within minutes.  “The bigger question is what the future stability of the slope is,” Hewett said. The bushes helped to stabilize the hill, he said.  Firefighters called city inspectors to check the safety of the hill and the homes on top of it.

A landslide on Hanley Road forced the road to close. Engineers said that a landslide is causing the asphalt to erode.  A resident said it would likely be three weeks before Hanley Road is fixed.  Crews are also concerned because there is a water main underneath the road which could be damaged by the slide.  Another closure was reported at Weik Road. One lane of Weik Road was coned off because a giant crack developed in the middle of one of the lanes.  On Tuesday, the left shoulder of the ramp from Ridge Road to southbound Interstate 71 was blocked by barrels after the pavement began to crumble and fall away from the road.  -----  Similar problems have popped up around southwest Ohio and northern Kentucky of late as the rain continues to pour.

Crews discovered a boulder in the right northbound lane and several rocks on the shoulder.  The slide, she said, is believed to have been caused by vegetation and the substantial amount of rain that fell in the area.

With the help of hydrologists, the department isolated a few of the Waldo Canyon burn scar's most vulnerable spots along U.S. 24 - one, just west of Manitou Springs near mile marker 296, was where Schroyer's car washed off the westbound lane and was swept down the hill. Wednesday's storm, which lasted only minutes, dumped over an inch in Waldo Canyon and .52 inches of rain in upper Williams Canyon, two of the higher danger zones on the burn scar, Torgerson said on Thursday. Some other danger spots are Wellington Gulch, in the central-south area of the burn scar. Then there are Glen Eyrie and Sand Gulch, by Chipita Park, both of which got minimal amounts of rain on Wednesday.","Highway 24 Near Manitou Springs (Mile Marker 296 To 298), Co",5km,mudslide,downpour,medium,unknown,0.0,,,,,GLC,5077.0,38.8634,-104.917,United States,US,Colorado,Colorado Springs,9.22,2014-04-01 00:00:00,2021-04-10 04:39:04,2424.tiff

The rain and snowmelt also caused landslides and washouts along the North and South forks of the Coeur d'Alene River, Saint Joe River and the tributaries that feed those drainages.  The flooding, landslides and washouts caused significant damage to roads, forcing the closure of many.

While heavy rain has been blamed for causing or contributing to some of the slides, officials are investigating to determine if a waterline on Butler Logan ruptured before or after the slide, PennDOT spokesman Jim Struzzi said on Tuesday.  The waterline has been repaired, a representative of the Fawn-Frazer Water Authority said.  About a 100-foot section of Butler Logan near Yutes Run has been affected and the road is closed, Struzzi said. He could not say when it would be repaired. Almost 2,400 vehicles travel on that area of the road daily.  The repair work ""is going to be extensive,"" Struzzi sai","Butler Logan rd. near Yutes Run rd., Frazer, PA",1km,landslide,downpour,small,unknown,0.0,,,,,GLC,3531.0,40.5813,-79.8024,United States,US,Pennsylvania,Pittsburgh,18.96,2014-09-12 20:20:06,2021-04-10 04:42:16,2981.tiff

It just down poured,"" Peterson said. The heavy rains were nerve-wracking for Peterson and her 14 family and friends, all thankful they were staying in cabins and not tents.

That will mean detours for westbound traffic.  WYDOT says it is hoping slide repairs can be complete by the first part of August.

The most recent was about 6:30 p.m. Monday.  A 48-hour moratorium on passenger travel is instituted following a landslide, said BNSF spokesman Gus Melonas. In the meantime, Amtrak was using charter buses to transport travelers between Portland and Seattle.  As a result of the Monday evening slide — which was in the same area as the first two — and the moratorium, passenger traffic on the north-south route is expected to resume Thursday morning, said Marc Magliari, an Amtrak spokesman.  The first slide, at 6:50 a.m. Saturday, covered a section of the BNSF Railway track between Vancouver’s rail junction and Felida.  Crews quickly cleared the mud, rocks, trees and other debris from each landslide.  Melonas said a shelf atop a 100-foot-high cliff adjacent to the tracks peeled off.

Original reports stated aid was called for three people; however, California Highway Patrol has updated the information to include all four people in a grey Toyota were transported to the hospital with non-serious injuries. The minor injuries included scrapes, bruises and knee pain. Florene Trainor of Caltrans stated there was a storm lasting around 30 minutes last night that caused the slide. The rains were possibly the proverbial Òlast strawÓ in an area already weakened by prior fires and slides from the California Aqueduct incident in 2010.","U.S. Highway 395 South Of Olancha Near Dunmovin, Ca",1km,mudslide,downpour,medium,unknown,0.0,4.0,,,,GLC,5170.0,36.1184,-117.9722,United States,US,California,Little Lake,21.31,2014-04-01 00:00:00,2021-04-10 04:47:09,3712.tiff

Some homeowners, like Tony and Debi DiTommaso, have been hit by flooding and mudslides at least three times in the last three years. After the first slide in the summer of 2010, the couple decided to leave the mud in place and put sod on top of it at their Lars Lane home off Fifth Street, Debi DiTommaso said. But when a second slide hit last month, they opted to scrape out the mud and grass and reseed their yard. The young grass was just starting to grow when a third mudslide buried their yard on Sept. 5. So last week, the mud and grass was once again removed. They still had to repair the irrigation system before planting more seed.

Boaters can still access from Lake Vesuvius.  “This landslide hit exactly where last year’s July windstorm caused a blowdown on the beach road”, says Ironton District Ranger Tim Slone. The slide is located 100-feet from the east end of the beach and is also blocking the Lakeshore Hiking Trail. “We’ve already re-located the Lakeshore Trail around the slide. Unfortunately the public will not be able to drive to the beach until the slip is fixed.”","Beach access road, Lave Vesuvius Recreation Area, Ironton, OH",1km,landslide,downpour,medium,unknown,0.0,,,,,GLC,1855.0,38.6198,-82.6276,United States,US,Ohio,Ashland Boyd County,12.08,2014-04-01 00:00:00,2021-04-10 04:42:16,3808.tiff
